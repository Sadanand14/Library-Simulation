It is a project created in the last week of January 2018(using CodeBlocks IDE) that carries out a basic simulation of a public library there are 3 classes library, book and human. 
Another class called member(which is a derived class of human) acts as a member of the library.
The primary focus of this project was to successfully exchange books(instances of the book class) between member and library without losing individual identities of the book instances.
The project was intended for practicing my concepts of OOP in C++.
